# reclink
⚫ Performed the memory-hungry task of linking between historical census records (1851-1911, UK & Wales) on HPC, achieved 45% match rate, a significant improvement on SOTA
⚫ Innovatively replacing expensive hand-labelling with iterative learning techniques like semi-supervision to acquire initial labels automatically, then reduced label noises with ensemble learning, largely saved cost for crowd-sourcing and manual labour
⚫ Extracted patent author using Named Entity Recognition (NER) building on rules
⚫ Designed a learning framework containing Machine Learning (ML) base learners, e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost and a higher synthesising neural network, efficiently handled label noise
